# Django Admin Blog Integration Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate static HTML pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, `base.html`, `post_detail.html`) into a Django admin application and render them dynamically within the Django framework.

## Features

- **Django Admin App**: A Django project with an app (`blog`) for integrating HTML pages into the Django admin interface.
- **HTML Templates**: Includes five main templates:
  - `base.html`: The base template that can be extended by other templates.
  - `about.html`: A page describing the blog or project.
  - `index.html`: The homepage of the blog.
  - `post_detail.html`: A detailed post page (could be used for showing individual blog posts).
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Renders the HTML templates through Django views.
- **URL Routing**: Configured URL routes to display the blog page at `/blog/` and individual post pages.
- **Customizable Admin Interface**: The app can be accessed and customized from the Django admin panel.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Django 3.x or higher

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
    cd yourprojectname
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the Django project:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/` to view the blog page.


## How It Works

- **Templates**: The project includes four main templates:
  - `base.html`: The base template that serves as the foundation for other templates.
  - `about.html`: A page describing the blog or project.
  - `index.html`: The homepage that lists blog posts.
  - `post_detail.html`: A page to display detailed information for an individual post (dynamic content can be added for each post).
- **Django Views**: Views in `blog/views.py` render these HTML templates.
- **URL Configuration**: The URLs are routed through `blog/urls.py`, which is connected to the main project’s `urls.py` file.
- **Django Admin Panel**: You can access and manage this app via the Django admin interface.

## Customization

You can modify the `index.html`, `about.html`, `base.html`, and `post_detail.html` files to suit your needs. To add more pages or functionality, you can:
- Add more templates to the `templates/blog/` directory.
- Create additional views in `views.py`.
- Update the URL patterns to handle more routes, such as a dynamic post detail page.
  
For example, in `post_detail.html`, you can use Django’s dynamic template rendering to show specific posts based on the URL (e.g., `/blog/post/<id>/`).
